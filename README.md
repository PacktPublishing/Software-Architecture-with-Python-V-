## About the Video Course
This video starts off by explaining how Python fits into an application architecture. As you move along, you will understand the architecturally significant demands and how to determine them. Later, youâ€™ll get a complete understanding of the different architectural quality requirements that help an architect to build a product that satisfies business needs, such as maintainability or reusability, testability, scalability, performance, usability, and security. 
This video will help you understand the ins and outs of Python so that you can make those critical design decisions that not just live up to but also surpass the expectations of your clients.
